# TODO:

\ implement "list groups" and/or "list contacts"
- deal with messages.reaction and only forward actual messages through the `message` event
- Ensure that ./data/ doesn't get spammed with anon creds
- WhatsAppSession to take an instantiated version of WhatsAppSessionStorage?
- Rename classes to not all be prefaced by WhatsApp?!?!?!?!

X handle messaging-history.set to init state
X make unsubscribe to read:messages
X come up with auth json transfer protocol for media
X make endpoint to get group metadata without joining
X make endpoint to leave group
X ugh... do whatsappstore. fine.
