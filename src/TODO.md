# TODO:

- handle messaging-history.set to init state
X make unsubscribe to read:messages
- come up with auth json transfer protocol
- implement "list groups" and/or "list contacts"
X make endpoint to get group metadata without joining
X make endpoint to leave group
- ugh... do whatsappstore. fine.
- deal with messages.reaction and only forward actual messages through the `message` event
